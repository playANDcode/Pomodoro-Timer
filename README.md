# Pomodoro-Timer
!!IMPORTANT!!
Install playsound module

Description

A console based pomodoro timer. In browsers, they are often bundled with other features. I hate it since they use lots of memory in ram. 
So I created a simple, not memory hungry pomdo timer.


Features:

Switch between 
Manual Pomodoro - Manually press enter to continue to next timer
Auto Pomodoro - Automatically continues to next timer
