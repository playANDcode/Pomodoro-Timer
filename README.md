**Description**

A console based pomodoro timer. In browsers, they are often bundled with other features. I hate it since they use lots of memory in ram. 
So I created a simple, not memory hungry pomdo timer.


**Features:**

- Switch between 
  Manual Pomodoro - Manually press enter to continue to next timer

  Auto Pomodoro - Automatically continues to next timer

- Ctrl + C to pause the timer
- Beautiful Sound Selection
