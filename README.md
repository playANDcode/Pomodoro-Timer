# Pomodoro-Timer

**(Important)** 

- Install the required modules by running the command: `pip install requirements.txt`

- Uses Python 3.9.1 but any version works as long as it's in Python 3. Any incompatibilities, please let me know. 

**How to run:**


- Copy the current directory of where pomodorov2.py is.

- Edit the "Run Pomodoro Tracker.cmd" and paste what you copied there. It's important not to remove the "quotation marks".

- Done! Just double click the "Run Pomodoro Tracker.cmd" to open the app.  

Bug: Running it in IDE's doesn't work. For it to work, your IDE must be in pomodoro's directory.



**Note:** Whenever you move the folder of the app, you have to repeat these steps again.

**Description**

A console based pomodoro timer. In browsers, they are often bundled with other features. I hate it since they use lots of memory in ram. 
So I created a simple, not memory hungry pomdo timer.

**Features:**

- Switch between 
  Manual Pomodoro - Manually press enter to continue to next timer

  Auto Pomodoro - Automatically continues to next timer

- Ctrl + C to pause the timer

- Low memory consumption
